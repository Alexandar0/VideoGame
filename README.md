# VideoGame
  This is a demo for a 2D video game made in Adventure Game Studio showing the creative capabilities of the engine. 
  
  The AGS engine uses custom scripting language similar to the C languages, so if you know C++ or any of them it would be easy for you to work in it and the possibilities are endless, but even if you don't know any of them it is visually simplified so even a user who doesn't know C can use it easy, there are also many online tutorials for it. 
  
  The engine is free to use for commercial and any purpose, find it online. The graphics used in this game are NOT mine and are NOT free for commercial use, they are just for training.
